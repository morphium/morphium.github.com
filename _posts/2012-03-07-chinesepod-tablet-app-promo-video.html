title: Promo Video for ChinesePod Tablet App
---

<p>
	In January I <a href="http://tronenko.net/2012/01/20/cpod-android-tablet-app/" target="_blank">wrote</a> about ChinesePod tablet <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chinesepod.tablet" target="_blank">application</a>, which I developed. ChinesePod host <a href="http://www.sinosplice.com/about" target="_blank">John Pasden</a> and his dog demonstrate how to use app's main features. 
By the way, the version, which is in the video does not yet have search implemented. But if you download the latest version now, you can search lessons from Library easily.
</p>
<p>
One of the coolest features of the app is avatar uploading, which took time for me to create.
Check the video below at 1:56 to see my face :) I became famous now :D
