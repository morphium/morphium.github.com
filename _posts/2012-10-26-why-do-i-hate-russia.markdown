title: Why do I, being Russian, hate Russia?
---

Today I found one very interesting article online which attracted me. I think it is rather exaggerated, but still I do agree with many aspects of it.
Originally, the article is in Russian, targeted at the Russian reader, so I decided to translate it into English:

	**Why do I, being Russian, hate Russia?**

	Russian citizens are ashamed of their country and despise it. (Almost every one of us thinks: “Yeah, a country of fools, indeed”). And those who don’t despise it are idiots or scoundrels. However, the last ones despise it too, but hide it thoroughly. Don’t you agree? Try to remember, honestly, for yourself with which emotions did you evaluate any events which take place in our country? For example, “only Russians could be treated like this”, “not surprising at all for our country”, “only our government can treat their citizens like this”, “in this case in USA they would… ”. Can you remember at least a single evaluation of a kind?

	Deep inside us there is a complex of “national inferiority”.

	There is a special form of patriotism, which is cultivating in Russia now, based only on hatred to others. Even if we talk about our merits, then, as a general rule, we say it like this: “our ancestors f**ked them all”, or “our missiles can f**king blow them up!”. This is an exact behavior of an evil nonentity, who feels with his guts the superiority of the people around. 

	Our tolerance to any abuse of the authorities over the people can be explained very easy: “when was it different?” and “can it be different?”.

	We are convinced in the normality of the situation.  Even if we elect a person we respect as our leader, we immediately start quietly hate and despise him. Because leader cannot be a clean-living person, and in Russia only a fool can care about people who depend on him, except, of course, his relatives and close friends.  The official by definition is a thief. However, he steals not from us, but from “the government”, and this fact determines our contemptuous condescension. Besides, all of us are not fools to steal something from “the government”, if there is an opportunity. No matter if it is a tax or a train ticket.  Saying more, for us the government is so called punitive authority, withstanding “the people”, something that gets in the way of our life, but also inevitable. We are the fatalists. 

	We are led by the defiance to the law, resulting from marginal “terms”, and the main of them is resisting the government.

	We despise our leaders, who don’t change anything in the current situation, also we hate those who decides to carry out reforms, inevitably causing tragic costs… Principal position of the Russian “citizen” – no matter what, never confess that you are responsible for the situation in the country, but hang all the dogs who were directly our indirectly authorized for what had happened. 

	We, unlike the inhabitants of the developed world, consider all the officials not as our wageworkers, but on the contrary, for us they are the one who always create more and more problems for us from a desire to extract bribes or just play a prank. The most surprising is that all those officials actually are trying hard to comply with such image, as if by the influence of the public stereotype. 

	It is not us, who are trying to seem to be “The Great Power” in castoffs. We are laughing at those attempts – since the childhood, from the anecdotes we made ourselves, we know, that we are born in the pile of manure; just “It is our motherland, my son”. 

	We are passionate about our “little homeland” and friends, but we despise our country and the people on the whole. Sometimes, we even gloat about the failures of our country at the international level – in those situations we treat our country as “the government”,  which in turn we perceive as our superior enemy. 

	In extreme conditions, from the army to the emigration, representative of any nation tries to help his or her tribesmen. But Russians are not like this. They would rather pretend to “nicht verstehen”, rather than get involved in the problems of his or her fellow countryman.

	On the trains heading abroad we see Russians as the most undesirable companions. We cannot even imagine more pompous, cad and stupid people. Seems like it is the most important national traits, which we can see in our countrymen. And in us ourselves. 

	I don’t know whose fault it is. Why are we like this? Bloody tsarism, Tatar-Mongols, the Bolsheviks or someone else? I don’t analyze, I am as a chukchee – I sing what I see. I just understand, that it is not the place and people, where and with whom I would like to live.
