title: MongoDB Conf in Shanghai
---

March 31, 2012 was Saturday. Although, because of Chinese holiday - [Qingming Festival](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qingming_Festival) - 
it was not a free day, but the 6th day of 7-day workweek (but then we had small vacation from Monday to Wednesday).

I was allowed to leave office and was very excited to attend conference, organized by creators of MongoDB - [10gen](http://www.10gen.com/events/mongodb-shanghai).

	Mongo Shanghai is a half-day conference in Shanghai, China dedicated to development with the open source, non-relational database MongoDB. 
	Presentations were delivered by MongoDB engineers and experienced MongoDB users. Talks were conducted in Chinese and English.

The conference took place in Shanghai High Technology Park.
I had chance to communicate with MongoDB developers, and was quite surprised that one of them, Kevin Matulef, was a subscriber of ChinesePod.
He told me he used to live in Beijing and was quite a lazy student.

Also, at this conference I accidentally met Baohua - a chinese developer who used to work in ChinesePod too. 4-5 years ago. 
His supervisor - a project manager at [The Net Circle](http://www.thenetcircle.com) - Milan from Slovakia is also a subscriber of ChinesePod and he told me he personally knows John Pasden.

That was a great day, where I met many interesting people and got priceless knowledge about developing and deploying with MongoDB.
Yep, I love Shanghai! :)
