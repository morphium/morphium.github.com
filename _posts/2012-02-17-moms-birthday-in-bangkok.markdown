title: My mom's birthday party in Bangkok

Today I want to share a bunch of funny pics of my parents, friends and me.

The last day in Thailand, Feb 10, we had an amazing birthday party in The Davis Hotel, which is located
in the very downtown of Bangkok, at Sukhumvit 24.

My mom cooked some Russian food for us, which was not very easy to do, because of lack of time and absence of experience in finding necessary ingredients in Thailand.

Besides, my parents were quite tired, since in the morning of the same day they went to see The Grand Palace.

But I think it was the great time, anyway. Thanks everyone for coming.

Once again, I want to say thank you to the hero of occasion, Wachi. She knows why. 

It is very very pity, that she could not join us.
