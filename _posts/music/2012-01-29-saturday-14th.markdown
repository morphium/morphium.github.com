This music was composed by me after a big CPod party on Friday 13<sup>th</sup>, that is it was a morning of Saturday 14<sup>th</sup>.
Here is a reason where a name of track came from. Saturday 14<sup>th</sup> - a calm and a quite day. The track is slow. I call it "A Hangover Music".

I am learning to use my new gear, which Michael suggested me to buy and Greg brought for me from USA.
I just spent few hours of Saturday's morning. May be the song is not mastered good enough, but I like it as it is now.
Hope you guys like it too. :)
