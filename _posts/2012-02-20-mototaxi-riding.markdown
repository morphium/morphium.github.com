Some people say it is quite dangerous to trust them. When you agree to get on this kind of taxi, you put your life in the hands of a person you've never met.

Anyway, this kind of transportation is very common, if not the most common, in the capital of Thailand, and also well spread in cities of China.

I prepared couple videos, which I took while riding motorcycle taxis in Shanghai and Bangkok, respectively. Both videos were taken in January, 2012.
