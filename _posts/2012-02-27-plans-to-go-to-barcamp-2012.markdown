title: Shanghai Barcamp - 2012 March 3
---

I am looking forward to visit [Shanghai Barcamp](http://www.techyizu.org/shanghai-barcamp-2012-march-3), that will take place on Saturday near Jing'an Temple.

My expectations for coming "un-conference" are higher than for the previous one. 
Also, the location is much more easier for me to get to.
Just about 15-20 minutes from the place I stay. 

[John B](http://biesnecker.com) just told me, that he signed up to make a presentation and is preparing slides now.
I am looking forward to attend it too.

By the way, my report from the previous Barcamp is still available [here](http://mh.malstream.info/notes/176).
I will try to prepare something like this for the coming event. 
*And this time I will have better camera ;)*

If you are in Shanghai now and you are interested in this event, I hope to see you there.
