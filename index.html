<h2>Hi all!</h2>

<br />

<p>My name is Roman Tronenko and you are visiting my Blog.</p>
<p>I write rather seldom, but I will try to share my thoughts, <br/>
ideas and impressions, if I have an inspiration.
</p>

<h3>Blog Posts:</h3> 
<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> : <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a> 
		{% if post.category == "music" %}
			<a href="/music"><span class="music label">Music</span></a>
		{% endif %} 
	</li> 
  {% endfor %}
</ul>


<p>I'm currently enjoying my life in Shanghai, China. Originally I am from suburbs of Saint-Petersburg, Russia. 
	Being not a native English-speaker, this Blog is also the way for me to improve my English skills, and if you found
	some grammar mistakes or inaccuracies, you are very welcomed to tell me. Please leave comments.
